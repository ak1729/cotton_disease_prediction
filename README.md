# cotton_disease_prediction
This is a Machine Learning project which predict the disease by which cotton plants are affected.
I have used Transfer Learning concepts to implement the model which are Inception V3, Resnet 50 and Resnet.
Among all model, Inception V3 gives the best accuracy which is 95 percent.
